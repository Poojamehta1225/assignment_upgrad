    <h2>Start by<span id="h1"> visualizing </span> your ideal self</h2>

   <p>Maybe your life has gone pretty smoothly according to guidelines parents, teachers, friends, and others have recommended. If that’s the case, you might not have given your true self much thought.

    Many people end up defining themselves by their relationships with others or the things they’ve always done, never considering the possibility of anything different.

    Without a clear idea of the things that matter to you or the person you hope to become, though, you’ll continue living for other people instead of yourself.

    You don’t need to begin with a complete picture — after all, your journey is all about discovering what the full picture is.</p>

<p>But try asking yourself things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
    What do I want from life?
</li>    
<li>   
    Where do I see myself in 5 years? 10?
</li>
<li>        
    What do I regret?
</li> 
<li>   
    What makes me proud of myself?
</li>     

</ul>

<p>The answers to these questions can give you a starting place.
<br>
If you get stuck, it can help to think back to a time when you felt fulfilled 
    <br>
    and happy and consider what contributed.

    <h2>Explore <span id="h1"> passions</span></h2>

<p>Passions help give life purpose and make it rich and meaningful.

Maybe a passion for helping others guided you to the field of medicine, but your current position in medical billing doesn’t quite fulfill your urge to provide compassionate care.

Living out your passion might involve identifying the job you really want and researching the steps necessary for a career change. Or, maybe it’s exploring ways to volunteer with your skills as a street medic.

Keep in mind that passions don’t always have to be complex or relate to professional interests. Think about what you spend your free time doing on a day-to-day basis. What excites you and brings joy to your life?

Even interests like movies and music can offer insight. Taking some time to consider what you enjoy and look forward to most can help you discover ways to enrich your life.

  <h2>  Evaluate your<span id="h1"> skills </span></h2>

 <p>Most people have a particular knack for something or other — crafting, home improvement, cooking, or any number of other skills. As part of the self-discovery process, you might consider taking some time to consider your unique abilities and how you might use them.

Maybe your friends always ask you to plan their parties or your neighbors regularly ask you for gardening tips. If these skills are something you can picture yourself developing, why not put them into practice?

Using your skills hones them, which can increase your confidence. Greater self-confidence, in turn, can encourage you to keep exploring these talents, along with any others you may not have noticed before.

   <h2>Identify what you <span id="h1"> about yourself</span></h2> 

<p>Your personal values, or the specific qualities you view as most important and meaningful, can tell you a lot about your nature. These values can help illustrate the life you want to live as well as the behavior you expect from others.
</p>
<p>Values might include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>  honesty</li>
  <li>compassion</li>
  <li> loyalty</li>
  <li> creativity</li>
  <li> courage</li>
  <li> intelligence</li>
</ul>
<p>Clarifying these values can help you make certain you’re living them out. If you’ve never taken the time to explore what principles you find most valuable, making this part of your self-discovery process can have a lot of benefit.

   <h2> Learn <span id="h1">something new</span></h2>

<p>Learning works best when it’s treated as a lifelong process.

If you’ve always wanted to learn more about something in particular, take the time to study it. Books, manuals, or online tools can teach you quite a bit, especially if you’d like to develop technical skills or study historical or scientific concepts.

Apps can help you get started learning anything from meditation to foreign languages, so if you have an interest, look it up — chances are good there’s an app or free website dedicated to it.

In the end, whether you choose to take a class, learn from someone in the community, or teach yourself a new skill, expanding your knowledge is always a wise move.
